# CAT-Whitepaper
Official whitepaper for the crypto apple trees project.

## Overview

It's a "cool thing on the blockchain", interest-bearing tradable assets, and a play-to-earn web3 game all rolled into one!

The Crypto Apple Trees project is a play-to-earn web3 platform and set of smart contracts for an erc20 token APPLE and erc721 NFT contract TREE that work together to form a fair and balanced ecosystem with a tokenomics model that combines inflationary and deflationary forces in a new and interesting way.
